## Getting Started

* Install Node and make sure npm is up-to-date <br>
* In root directory of project run ```npm install``` <br>
* Depeding on your Node configuration, you may have to install the Angular CLI manually: ```npm install -g @angular/cli@latest```, remove -g if you want to install locally <br>
* ```npm start``` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in Chrome (browser support limited) <br>


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
